        <h1>My Football Journey</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">My football story began like many others — with a ball, a dream, and two shoes way too big for me. I was six years old when I joined my first team. Back then, I had no idea that football would shape my mindset, my friendships, and my leadership skills for the years to come.</p>

        <h2>Bjarg</h2>
        <p>Where it all started. I was just a kid learning how to kick a ball without falling over.</p>
        <p>I did however not take long before things started to get serious. At age 7, my dad became the coach of my team. 
          It did not take long before one session a week turned into four sessions with the team, in addition to individual work in my spare time.
        </p>

        <p>
          One year later, I was good enough to train with older players. This was a large boost in confidence, and motivated me to work even harder.

        <h2>Brann</h2>
        <img src="Fotballbilde/BRANN-KØBEN.JPG" class="team-photo" />
        <p>At age 13 i was requested to join Brann's youth academy. To this day, recieving this message is one of the happiest days of my life.</p>
        <p>Joining Brann’s youth academy was my first exposure to elite football. The bar was high—and I loved it.</p>
        <img src="Fotballbilde/brann-itec.JPG" class="team-photo" />
        <p>At this point, there was no other thing then football on my mind. My life consisted of training before school, school, another session after school, homework and sleeping. There was no time to mess around.</p>
        <p>Even though it was hard work, it was extremely rewarding. I got to experience my dream at a very young age. High stakes, big tournaments, beating large European Clubs, and traveling with the team. It was a blast.</p>
        <p>At the span of my three years at Brann, I got to play alongside current national team players. We won tournaments, and was known to be the best team in Norway at our age.</p>
        <img src="Fotballbilde/kretsmerster.JPG" class="team-photo" />
        <p>But, like all fairytales, it all comes to an end. When I was 16 I recieved the hardest message of my life. I was no longer guaranteed a spot in the team. </p>

      <section id="fana" class="team-section">
        <h2>Fana</h2>
        <p>At Fana, I focused on development, learned patience, and pushed through injury setbacks. </p>

        <p>After leaving Brann, I wanted to find a clud where I could develop. Here, it did not take lokg before I played for three different teams. Boys 19, the B-team and the A-team (mostly benchwarming unfortunately). </p>
        <p>In one season, I played more than 70 full games. Here, I gained experience. My goal was still to become a professional, hence I trained like before. Strict diets, individual practice and high stakes - but ultimately very rewarding and fun. </p>
        <p>At Fana, I got to experinece what it means to be a leader. Getting a lot of experience meant expectation of taking responsibility. While I was looking up to my teammates at the A-team, I was at the same time captain for both boys-19 and the B-team. I was learning from my peers, and preaching to others. </p>
        <p>Looking back, I believe the time i had at Fana has been the time where I grew the most, both as a player, but also as a person, outside football </p>
        <img src="Fotballbilde/Fana-voksen.JPG" class="team-photo" />
        <p>At the end of my time at Fana, I decided i was going to apply to Ivy league schools in USA. In that setting, I had to make a highlight video. Here it is for the ones who are interested :)</p>

        <h2>University of Michigan</h2>
        <p>
          During my exchange semester at University of Michigan, I got to experience why i really love football. During these six months, I played alongside some amazing people. This time however, the goal was to have fun, rather than to be the best. 
        </p>
        <img src="Fotballbilde/Umich-press.jpg" class="team-photo" />
        <p>I played for two different teams at Umich. The club-team, and the MBA team. Here i got lifelong frinedships, a lot of fun experiences and played, just for fun!</p>

        <h2>Fyllingsdalen</h2>
        <p> After returning from exchange, I did not have a club where I could return and feel welcome. At this point, I was considering ending my career. </p>
        <p>I had some friends at Fyllingsdalen who convinced me to try out there. I joined the B-team, playing in 5. division. After a short while, I was also welcome to train with the A-team. </p>
        <img src="Fotballbilde/fyllingsdalen-huse.JPG" class="team-photo" />
        <p>My home at Fyllingsdalen did however become the B-team, where I was named team captain. This was a team consisting of up and coming players. I was surrounded by a lot of talent, but we lacked experience. </p>

        <h2>Lyngbø</h2>
        <p>
          On the verge of giving up on football, I got a call from Lyngbø. The message was clear, they wanted to win the league, and they wanted me to be a part of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I gave football one last chance, and the rest was history. The season provided memories for a lifetime. Playing every game, becoming part of a family, and enjoying football again.
        </p>
        <p>Now, I am at the peak of my career! Im playing at the highest level I have ever played, having out supporters, the Ultras, screaming our names, creating a fantastic ambiance for each game, and playing at high stakes. I could not ask for anything else, and the story keeps on going.</p>

        <p>
          From the youth system at <strong>SK Brann</strong> to winning the league at <strong>Lyngbø IL</strong>,
          every chapter had its own lessons. Brann gave me a taste of elite youth football, while Lyngbø taught me how to work with a team through
          both wins and losses.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          “Football taught me to fight for others, not just for myself.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          I still carry that team-first mentality with me, whether I'm working on a group project or helping lead a student organization.
          Football was never just about goals — it was about grit, community, and growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          These days, I don’t train five times a week anymore. But I do bring the same discipline and energy into everything I do —
          from auditing oil companies at EY to chasing impact in student-led events.
