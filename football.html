      <section class="post-content">
        <p>
          My football story began like many others ‚Äî with a ball, a dream, and two shoes way too big for me.
          I was five years old when I joined my first team. Back then, I had no idea that football would shape my mindset,
          my friendships, and my leadership skills for the years to come.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the youth system at <strong>SK Brann</strong> to taking the captain‚Äôs armband at <strong>Lyngb√∏ IL</strong>,
          every chapter had its own lessons. Brann gave me a taste of elite youth football, while Lyngb√∏ taught me how to lead a team through
          both wins and losses.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          ‚ÄúFootball taught me to fight for others, not just for myself.‚Äù
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          I still carry that team-first mentality with me, whether I'm working on a group project or helping lead a student organization.
          Football was never just about goals ‚Äî it was about grit, community, and growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          These days, I don‚Äôt train five times a week anymore. But I do bring the same discipline and energy into everything I do ‚Äî
          from auditing oil companies at EY to chasing impact in student-led events.
