        <h1>My Football Journey</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">My football story began like many others ‚Äî with a ball, a dream, and two shoes way too big for me. I was five years old when I joined my first team. Back then, I had no idea that football would shape my mindset, my friendships, and my leadership skills for the years to come.</p>

        <h2>Bjarg</h2>
        <p>Where it all started. I was just a kid learning how to kick a ball without falling over.</p>
        <p>I did however not take long before things started to get serious. At age 7, my dad became the coach of my team. 
          It did not take long before one session a week turned into four sessions with the team, in addition to individual work in my spare time.
        </p>
        <p>
          One year later, I was good enough to train with older players. This was a large boost in confidence, and motivated me to work even harder.

      <section id="brann" class="team-section">
        <h2>Brann</h2>
        <p>At age 13 i was requested to join Brann's youth academy. To this day, recieving this message is one of the happiest days of my life.</p>
        <p>Joining Brann‚Äôs youth academy was my first exposure to elite football. The bar was high‚Äîand I loved it.</p>
        <p>At this point, there was no other thing then football on my mind. My life consisted of training before school, school, another session after school, homework and sleeping. There was no time to mess around.</p>
        <p>Even though it was hard work, it was extremely rewarding. I got to experience my dream at a very young age. High stakes, big tournaments, beating large European Clubs, and traveling with the team. It was a blast.</p>
        <p>But, like all fairytales, it all comes to an end. When I was 16 I recieved the hardest message of my life. I was no longer guaranteed a spot in the team. </p>

      <section id="umich" class="team-section">
        <h2>University of Michigan</h2>
        <p>
          During my exchange semester at University of Michigan, I got to experience why i really love football. During these six months, I played alongside some amazing people. This time however, the goal was to have fun, rather than to be the best. 
        </p>
        <p>I played for two different teams at Umich. The club-team, and the MBA team. Here i got lifelong frinedships, a lot of fun experiences and played, just for fun!</p>

        <h2>Fyllingsdalen</h2>
        <p>A club with ambition. This is where I started to think like a team player‚Äînot just an individual.</p>

      <section id="lyngbo" class="team-section">
        <h2>Lyngb√∏</h2>
        <p>Here, I became captain. I learned to lead from the front, both in wins and in tough seasons.</p>

        <p>
          My football story began like many others ‚Äî with a ball, a dream, and two shoes way too big for me.
          I was five years old when I joined my first team. Back then, I had no idea that football would shape my mindset,
          my friendships, and my leadership skills for the years to come.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the youth system at <strong>SK Brann</strong> to taking the captain‚Äôs armband at <strong>Lyngb√∏ IL</strong>,
          every chapter had its own lessons. Brann gave me a taste of elite youth football, while Lyngb√∏ taught me how to lead a team through
          both wins and losses.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          ‚ÄúFootball taught me to fight for others, not just for myself.‚Äù
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          I still carry that team-first mentality with me, whether I'm working on a group project or helping lead a student organization.
          Football was never just about goals ‚Äî it was about grit, community, and growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          These days, I don‚Äôt train five times a week anymore. But I do bring the same discipline and energy into everything I do ‚Äî
          from auditing oil companies at EY to chasing impact in student-led events.
